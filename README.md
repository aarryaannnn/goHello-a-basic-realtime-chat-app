# goHello-a-basic-realtime-chat-app
Hi there,

This is a simple chat app based on MERN stack, which features one-to-one realtime conversation.
This is just a simple version of my current ongoing goHello project, which containes all essentail features, like voice call, video call, files transfer, friend request, online-offline users, and much more.
Made this project to ensure that my main project doesn't get messed up.

If you guys are interested then, you can also take this project further by implementing something like, if the user is online or offline, fix bugs if found, and more

Thank you ;)
